.shelf files for each shelf are lists of item guids

.item files for each named item
	define commands connected to each "slot"
	define icon information
	define label information
	define new/highlight information
	define stylesheet/visuals




prefs/shelf2/
	items/
		.item files
	.shelf files

both items and commands are assigned guids
	when duplicates are detected (Someone trying a copy/paste or manual editing error) assign a new guid
	pick which item of the duplicates gets a new guid based on file age, if tied, base on alpha sort



Shelf interaction:
	modes: (left click)
		button
		instant popup
		delayed popup
		menuButton popup

	custom context menu (Right click)
		Define a custom indicator for this, standard language if any exists?
		Arrow doesn't work, since it may be a delayed/instant popup. Must avoid bottom right corner, and probably top right as well
